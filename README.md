# Drum Machine using React

A project for freeCodeCamp. A musical drum machine that plays sounds when the keys are pressed. It should look a bit similar to this:

### I used these languages to create this project
```html
<div>
  <p>HTML</p>
  <p>CSS</p>
  <p>JavaScript</p>
  <p>React.js</p>
</div>
```

> I used React.js as the framework to create this project, along with HTML and CSS.

### What was the aim?
* The goal is to create a musical keypad drum machine that plays different sounds when specific keys are pressed.
* The keypad should also have the option to be muted or to choose the custom volume.
* There also needed to be a button that could switch between two different musical drum types.
