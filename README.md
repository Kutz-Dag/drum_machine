# Drum Machine
A musical drum machine that plays sounds when the keys are pressed.
This was a project for freeCodeCamp.
I used React.js as my JavaScript framework to create this project, along with HTML and CSS.
The goal is to create a musical keypad drum machine that plays different sounds when specific different keys are pressed.
The keypad should also have the option to be muted or to choose the custom volume.
There also needed to be a button that could switch between two different musical drum types.
